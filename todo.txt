Thoughts 3/31:
    Do I add .env?
    Is log in necessary?
        No
    Multiple tables for different locations? Or all one on a list or locations/titles?
    How to set experience level?

Thoughts 4/4:
    Added .env to show formatting and for potential use later
    Need to add emails to .env
    Email structure?
        How do I scrape to show in the email? Do I just send links or do I make it look nice.
